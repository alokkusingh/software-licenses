Type of Software Licenses

## There are five types of common software license models
### Public domain
This is the most permissive type of software license. When software is in the public domain, anyone can modify and use the software without any restrictions.
### Permissive
Also known as “Apache style” or “BSD style.” They contain minimal requirements about how the software can be modified or redistributed.
#### Apache Liense
#### BSD License
#### MIT License
### LGPL
The GNU Lesser General Public License allows you to link to open source libraries in your software. If you simply compile or link an LGPL-licensed library with your own code, you can release your application under any license you want, even a proprietary license. But if you modify the library or copy parts of it into your code, you’ll have to release your application under similar terms as the LGPL.
### Copyleft
Copyleft licenses are also known as reciprocal licenses or restrictive licenses. The most well-known example of a copyleft or reciprocal license is the GPL. These licenses allow you to modify the licensed code and distribute new works based on it, as long as you distribute any new works or adaptations under the same software license.
### Proprietary
All rights are reserved. It’s generally used for proprietary software where the work may not be modified or redistributed.
